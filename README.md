# Application Server

The application server is a powerful tool that processes every requests coming from the proxy. It facilitates various functions, from notfication, caching to datbase communication, to optimizing network performance. This README provides a concise overview of a basic proxy server application.

## Introduction

The Application Server is designed to handle requests between proxy and servers. It intercepts requests from proxy and forwards them to the appropriate destination server, while also handling responses and routing them back to the proxy.

## Features

- **System Caching**: The application server serves as an in-memory database for the application
- **IPC**: It captures and relays communications between the several servers using gRPC, AMQP, and Webhook
- **Security**: Using cryptograph system for secure communication.

## Usage

To use the server application, follow these steps:

1. **Install**: Install the proxy server application on your desired server.
2. **Configure**: Configure the proxy settings, including target server addresses and caching preferences.
3. **Run**: Start the proxy server application.
4. **Client Configuration**: Configure clients to route requests through the proxy server.

## Installation

1. Clone this repository: `git clone [https://github.com/Chibueze-Adeyemi-Ajayi/ProxyServer/]`
2. Navigate to the project directory: `cd app-server`
3. Install dependencies: `npm install`
